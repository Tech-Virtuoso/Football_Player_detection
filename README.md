# Football Player Detection using YOLOv8 and Roboflow

ü§ñ‚öΩ Welcome to the Football Player Detection project! üöÄ

## Overview
This repository showcases my work on implementing football player detection using the YOLOv8 model and leveraging the capabilities of Roboflow for efficient dataset management. The project focuses on real-time video analysis to accurately identify and track football players.

## Key Features
- **Video-based Detection:** Achieved precise detection and tracking of football players in video streams.
- **Pre-trained Model:** Utilized the YOLOv8 pre-trained model for faster development and improved accuracy.

## YOLOv8 Information
Developed by Alexey Bochkovskiy, YOLOv8 (You Only Look One-level up) is an evolution of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series, renowned for its speed and accuracy in real-time object detection. YOLOv8 incorporates advancements in model architecture, making it a robust choice for diverse detection tasks.

## Project Structure
- **`src/`:** Contains the source code for the football player detection implementation.
- **`data/`:** Includes the dataset used for training and testing.
- **`docs/`:** Documentation and additional resources for better understanding and usage.

## Contributions
Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome! Feel free to dive in and help make this project even better.

Let's kick off some exciting object detection adventures! ‚öΩüîç‚ú®
